                <h1>What Joe Biden’s election victory means for environmentally-conscious consumers</h1>
                <p>
                    With states across the United States certifying their votes, scientists across the country (and world) can breathe a
                    collective sigh of relief as the inauguration of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris appears all
                    but certain. The upcoming administration promises to take climate change seriously and has already outlined several
                    actions to put the United States back into the climate conversation. The current administration has taken a very
                    different, almost dismissive, approach to environmental policy. Come January, climate-conscious citizens will finally
                    have a government that will work with them to solve these issues. But much has to be done to regain lost ground. What
                    specifically has the Trump administration done, and what how does the Biden administration plan to minimize the
                    environmental effects Trump has caused?
                </p>
                <h4>Trump administration’s environmental policies</h4>
                <p>
                    President Donald Trump has always viewed environmental regulations as bad for the bottom-line, and thus his
                    administration has handled environmental issues vastly differently than how the Biden administration will handle these
                    same issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    President Trump’s four years of environmental policy boil down to a few key concepts. First, his administration has
                    repeatedly valued fossil fuel companies very highly, to the point where they often take precedence over environmental
                    considerations like preservation of biodiversity ( keeping our air and waters clean, and protecting public lands). Trump
                    has also repeatedly decried science as a whole, removing climate change from environmental agency websites, hiring
                    climate-deniers to chief scientific positions, and cutting science research funding (and here). Trump also withdrew the
                    United States from the Paris Climate Accord. Finally, he made it a mission to roll back environmental policies created
                    by the Obama administration. These include (but are not limited to) completely rewriting the Clean Power Plan to be more
                    corporate-friendly; cutting the EPA budget by 30%; and reducing regulations on pollution (DailyDot). In total, President
                    Trump rolled back over one hundred environmental policies, with the goal of freeing corporations from governmental
                    restrictions.
                </p>
                <h4>Biden’s Climate Action Plan</h4>
                <p>
                    According to the Biden-Harris transition website BuildBackBetter, the President-Elect will make large investments in
                    eight major sectors of the climate economy: Infrastructure, Auto Industry, Transit, Power Sector, Buildings, Housing,
                    Agriculture and Conservation, and Environmental Justice. In summary, his plan involves aggressive federal spending on
                    development of new (or improvement of existing) houses, buildings, and infrastructure, and on clean energy research and
                    development. Biden-Harris also commit to creating jobs in sustainable agriculture and conservation and tackling
                    environmental racism. He even appointed the first-ever “climate czar” in John Kerry, reaffirming his commitment to
                    addressing climate change as a national security threat.
                    Their strongest differentiator from President Trump’s environmental policies is focus on humanity / unity. The Biden
                    administration wants every voice included when addressing climate change. This includes implementing policies put forth
                    by progressive Democratic politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. While Joe Biden has not fully endorsed the Green
                    New Deal, he promises to implement parts of it, including increasing generation of renewable energy, increase fuel
                    efficiency of vehicles, and invest in more sustainable buildings and homes (NYTimes).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most scientists will agree that international cooperation is crucial for climate change mitigation, and this starts with
                    a President that is committed to unity across -- and within -- party lines.
                </p>
                <h4>What does this mean for consumers?</h4>
                <p>
                    For consumers that wish to enact a more sustainable lifestyle, President-elect Joe Biden’s pro-environmental policies
                    will naturally encourage more businesses to run more sustainably, such as using only sustainably-harvested products.
                    With small businesses feeling additional pressure from consumers to place more value on people and planet, and with
                    President-elect Joe Biden’s intent to create a Small Business Fund, consumers can expect to see more small,
                    environmentally-conscious businesses in their communities. This, compounded with his plan to invest in sustainable
                    development and clean energy initiatives, will make finding local small businesses demonstrating some degree of
                    sustainability much easier.

                <h1>Plastic-free alternatives for your bathroom</h1>
                <p>
                    It is no secret that plastics have simultaneously become civilization’s greatest solution and its greatest curse.
                    They’re lightweight, versatile, and inexpensive, but because of this, plastics of many forms are found in products that
                    you wouldn’t expect. Of course, the current pandemic does little to change this; N95, surgical, and even disposable
                    paper masks are littered with plastic components. If every citizen in Britain wore one disposable mask every day for a
                    year, approximately 73,000 tons of plastic waste would be produced. Consumers can make significant changes in their
                    environmental impact by knowing what common household items contain plastics. Not only will replacing these items
                    benefit the environment, doing so can also benefit your physical health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In honor of Plastic-Free July, listed below are brands that sell non-plastic, all-natural bathroom products in
                    non-plastic, recyclable, or compostable packaging.

                    In general, when thinking about reducing plastic waste, doing research on a product’s packaging is often a good step to
                    finding brands that make plastic-free, all-natural products. Nevertheless, making an educated decision before adding a
                    product to your cart is vital to taking control of your environmental impact. Websites like Life Without Plastic,
                    EcoRoots, and Habitat are great sites to browse if you are curious about the zero-waste lifestyle.

                    <b>However, the most sustainable product is the one you currently own. Use the products you already have until they run out
                    or are no longer functional; only then does it make sense to switch to these plastic-free products.</b>

                <br><br><br><br>
                <h1>Meat: Less is more to help the environment</h1>
                <p>
                    A majority of humans are concerned about climate change but are unsure how to make an individual difference. Veganism
                    has grown globally and has led to more awareness of the meat production process. Also, environmental concerns have more
                    people buying plant-based meat alternatives. But what specifically about meat is so bad for the environment? Is it
                    enough to simply buy local or “grass-fed” meat, or is the meat industry more nuanced?
                </p>
                <h4>Does Local Matter?</h4>
                <p>
                    Food emits greenhouse gases (GHG) at every life stage, but the impact of each stage varies with the type of food. Meats
                    by far have the highest environmental impact, while plants have the lowest. What makes meat more carbon-intensive than
                    plants? The difference comes in land-use change and farming.
                    As an example, let’s analyze the land use and farming required to produce beef, the largest GHG emitter. Cows need vast
                    areas of grassland, which often need to be converted from forests and other natural ecosystems; cows grazing on
                    deforested land contribute twelve times more GHG and use fifty times more land than those grazing on natural pastures.
                    Thus, unsurprisingly, livestock is grown on more than 80% of the world’s farmland but produces less than 20% of the
                    world’s calories. Cows also require a lot of fresh water and produce methane, a potent GHG. While beef is the most
                    damaging, other meats are bad for the environment for similar reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many people who would rather buy meat locally than remove meat from their diets. After all, doing this reduces
                    unnecessary emissions by planes, ships, and trucks. However, transportation from producer to consumer explains less than
                    5% of food emissions, while land-use and farmland emissions make up more than 80% for most foods. Even grass-fed beef is
                    much more carbon-intensive than plant-based foods. So it’s safe to say that consuming less meat, rather than local meat,
                    will reduce your carbon footprint.
                </p>
                <h4>Squashing the Beef</h4>
                <p>
                    While cutting out meat completely is too daunting of a lifestyle change for many, eating chicken instead of beef cuts
                    one's food emissions by 25%. For meat lovers who cannot live without the taste of beef, there are other ways to reduce
                    food emissions. Plant-based meats such as Beyond and Impossible taste like regular beef while requiring significantly
                    less land and water to produce. Another option is eating less meat. Eating 25% less meat can save enough high-quality
                    land to cover all of Indiana. Even easier, if every American went vegetarian for one day a week, we would save 100
                    billion gallons of water and reduce our carbon footprint by 1.2 million tons of CO2 annually.
